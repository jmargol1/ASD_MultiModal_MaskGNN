## Install Dependencies

All dependencies should be stored in requirements.txt file. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies properly

## sMRI + fMRI models (ABIDE I data)

Files related to this portion are in ASD2 Folder

To run the fMRI models open Jupyter Notebook `fMRI_MaskGNN.ipynb` and run all --> approximately 5 hours to run in full

To run the sMRI models open Jupyter Notebook `sMRI_MaskGNN.ipynb` and run all --> Approximately 1 hour to run in full

To run the Fusion Model with same structure as fMRI and sMRI open Jupyter Notebook `FusionMaskGNN.ipynb` and run all --> Approximately 2 hours to run in full

To run the Fusion Model with tuned architecture open Jupyter Notebook `FusionMaskGNNTuned.ipynb` and run all --> Approximately 2 hours to run in full
